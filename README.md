# Malaria_cell_detection
Malaria dataset contains 27,558 cell images classified into two groups called parasitized and uninfected cells, where each cell contains an equal number of instances. Data was taken from 150 P. falciparum and 50 healthy patients and it was photographed at Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh using a smartphone by placing it on the conventional light microscope [26]. Manual annotation was performed later by an expert slide reader at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit. In this data, parasitized samples mean that there is the presence of Plasmodium, whereas the uninfected samples refer to the absence of Plasmodium but there may be presence of other objects like staining artefacts/impurities.

While studying the dataset, some of the labelled data raised suspicion of whether they were correctly labelled. Some of the data seems like uninfected but labelled as parasitized, where some parasitized images are labelled as uninfected.
